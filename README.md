This respiratory includes two tasks for the Electrical power and power electronics majors. The first task will turn five servo motors from 
0 to 90 degrees and return from 90 to 0 degrees. The second task will control five servo motors using variable resistors to turn servo motors from 0 to 90 degrees and 90 to 0 degrees.
